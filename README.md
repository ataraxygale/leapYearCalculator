Leap Year Calculator

## 📦 Notes
- This is part of a growing set of small programs documenting my Python learning journey.
-  ⚙️✨

## 🧠 How It Works
- The leap year calculator prompts the user to enter a year
- The program calculates if the year is a leap year or not
- After outputting the resulta, the user is prompted to continue or enter 0 to exit the program

## 🧪 Example Output
```
Input a Year: 2000
2000 is a leap year! *frog noises*

Enter 0 to exit the program or any other key to continue

Input a Year: 2025
2025 is a common year

Enter 0 to exit the program or any other key to continue
0

Process finished with exit code 0
```
